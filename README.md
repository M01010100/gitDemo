|  -- Git Demo for NCS / CS club meetings at SUNY Polytechnic Institute --  | 
|___________________________________________________________________________|
|  Done in order to make sure the student at SUNYPI have an understanding   |
|  of git and how to use from the comamnd line along with the editor.       |
|                                                                           |
|  side note: I published through VScode as it is easier to have students   |
|  log in through the website then educate them on ssh key management,      |
|  creation, and usage.                                                     |
